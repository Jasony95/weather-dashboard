# Weather Forecast

## Description

- The motivation was to create a webpage to help users to see the current weather along with the next five days.
- I build this project to help users be able to see the weather ahead.
- It solves the problem of having to see cities weather using other tools/software.
- I learned that there needs to be arrangement of the code in order to make it work along with structuring the data.
